I started the Data Analyst Nanodegree (DAND) with very limited coding experience. I'd completed their [Intro to Computer Science](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-computer-science--cs101) years before and so I was vaguely familiar with it upon arrival.

Each of the 'subjects' within the course has a project as the final assessment. It's a pass/fail system and you can submit as many times as you want, receiving feedback on what is required to meet the rubric, as many times until you get this right. I really actually like this approach as I think it fosters learning.

I'd completed the first project on [Exploring Weather Trends](https://github.com/rebeccaebarnes/DAND-Project-1/blob/master/Project%201%20DAND%20REB.pdf) relatively easily - a little bit of SQL and a bunch of extra analysis that was mine to include and not required to meet the project rubric.

The Intro to Python subject was a completely different matter! It definitely felt like trial by fire. I was able to complete the lesson material with reasonable progression, but the project took it to a whole other level!! The project provides us with real life datasets about the use of a Bikeshare program in the US. While they are still working on improving the project to improve the experience for students, when I encountered it, we had csv files of over a million lines of code, and the need to use `DictReader` to read the file. I spent **1.5 hours** along trying to get a usable version of the data.

But I'm a big fan of persistence! It took me more than 40 hours to get it done (I track my time with [toggle](https://toggl.com/)) but I passed on first submission!

If you would like to look at the original code, you can find it [here](https://github.com/rebeccaebarnes/DAND-Project-2/blob/master/bikeshare.py).

I'm hoping that I'll be able to update the project in the future with some of the functionality I held off adding just to get it submitted! Check [here](https://github.com/rebeccaebarnes/DAND-Project-2/blob/Updated-project/bikeshare.py) for updates to the code.
