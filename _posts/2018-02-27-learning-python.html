    This is honestly what learning to code sometimes feels like - trying to navigate twists and turns of a brand new language, while other people sit around and have opinions. ;)
    As I've said before, I started the Data Analyst Nanodegree (DAND) with very limited coding experience.
    The second project for the DAND was a Python project. We were provided a dataset about the use of the Bikeshare program (with one of the original csv files having more the a million lines of data!).
    Our job was to create a program that could take user input to filter the results and display a number of specified use statistics.

    You can check out the actual project and the code in its <a href = "https://github.com/rebeccaebarnes/DAND-Project-2">repo</a> and I'll provide some highlights below.
