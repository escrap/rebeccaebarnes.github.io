        Heading to the good ol' land of Oz in sunny Queensland for a few week's vacation (and a bit of Commonwealth Games).
        To me a good vacation consists of lying by a pool, or on the beach, doing not much, and reading.
        So here's what's on my vacation reading list, we'll see how much of it I get through:

    <h3>1. Court of Special Appeals Opinion on Post-Conviction Relief in the Adnan Syed case</h3>

    <img style="height: 20em" class="centre-img" src="/img/adnan.jpg" alt="Adnan Syed">
    <p style="margin-left: 25%; margin-top: 0.5em"><small>Source: <a href="https://mobile.nytimes.com/2018/03/29/us/adnan-syed-serial.html#click=https://t.co/0fUG6pWFaG">New York Times</a></small></p>

    <p>
        If you never caught up with the award-winning first season of <a href="https://serialpodcast.org/season-one" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Serial</a>, where have you been? ;)
        And if you didn't get a chance to follow-up with one of it's spin-offs, <a href="http://undisclosed-podcast.com/episodes/season-1/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Undisclosed</a>, you're missing out.
        <br>
        <br>
        But briefly, in 1999 a young man by the name of Adnan Syed was arrested, and later convicted of kidnapping and murdering his ex-girlfriend.
        When Serial brought attention to the case, it highlighted some of the inconsistencies in the presented evidence, and then Undisclosed went on to really bring it home as a team of lawyers engaged in some of the most in-depth evidence analysis I think most people would be able to find publicly available.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Reading because:</strong> Syed won the right to pursue post-conviction relief for his case and the ensuing legal process has been ongoing since around 2014.
        This week the opinion of the Court of Special Appeals in Maryland has come down, over one year since the hearing was held.
        They've upheld the vacation of his original conviction (as per the trial court to which the matter was originally remanded) but on different grounds than the trial court.
        <br>
        <br>
        Reading through the <a href="https://www.courts.state.md.us/data/opinions/cosa/2018/2519s13.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">full opinion</a> is first on my list.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Anne of Green Gables: Anne of Windy Poplars and beyond</h3>

    <p style="margin-left: 25%; margin-top: 0.5em"><small>Source: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088727/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IMDb</a></small></p>
    <p>
        <strong>Reading because:</strong> To know Anne is to love her!
        And because there's something pleasurably nostalgic about visiting childhood friends and finding them all over again from a different perspective.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Superforecasting: The Art and Science of Prediction</h3>

    <img style="height: 20em" class="centre-img" src="/img/superforecasting.jpg" alt="Superforecasting book cover">
    <p style="margin-left: 40%; margin-top: 0.5em"><small>Source: <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Superforecasting-Science-Prediction-Philip-Tetlock-ebook/dp/B015LYZGW6/ref=sr_1_1_twi_kin_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1522567605&sr=8-1&keywords=superforecasting+the+art+and+science+of+prediction" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Amazon.ca</a></small></p>

    <p>
        <strong>Reading because:</strong> Because after <a href="https://rebeccaebarnes.github.io/2018/03/28/super-predictors" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">talking about it</a>, it seemed 'the right thing to do'.
        But also because it seems like an interesting way to get even more insight into this field of data science.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Data Science from Scratch: First Principle with Python</h3>

    <img style="height: 20em" class="centre-img" src="/img/data-science-book.jpg" alt="Data Science book cover">
    <p style="margin-left: 40%; margin-top: 0.5em"><small>Source: <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Data-Science-Scratch-Principles-Python-ebook/dp/B00W4DTP2A/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1522568082&sr=1-1&keywords=data+science+from+scratch+first+principles+with+python" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Amazon.ca</a></small></p>

    <p>
        <strong>Reading because:</strong> Because I truly do get nerdily happy about this stuff and especially love reading when people write in interesting ways about things I enjoy.
        We'll have to see how much of this one I get through, because I have a suspicion that it could benefit from actually working on coding while I'm doing it.
