    Working in homelessness was the initial motivator for my pursuits in data analysis and beyond.
    I watched us collect a lot of data but often use it to an extent that seemed well below maximum potential.
    I wanted to be able to better with what we had - to use the information to better understand how we can effectively address homelessness.

<p>
    And so I've decided to embark on the beginnings of that pursuit with a new <a href="https://github.com/rebeccaebarnes/Homelessness" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Understanding Homelessness</a> repo.
    I don't yet have all of the skills that I will need to be able to do what I would like to be able to do, but the goal is to be able to examine the relationships between changes in homelessness numbers and structural factors such as rental prices, unemployment and education.
    (As opposed to the often more commonly discussed individual factors such as addiction, mental health and other personal factors)
    My hope is that one day I might be able to use all of this to be able to effectively model changes in homelessness.
</p>
<p>
    At the moment, the task is validating and cleaning the data I have been able to obtain, but when that is all done, I'll move on to some descriptive exploration and then some multiple linear regression.
    As I said, eventually the hope is to be able to use the information in modeling.
