    <p>
        Well I'm bouncing around distracted, because I'm waiting to start DAND Term 2!
        It seemed high time to do another 'what I've learned' post - I missed the last month because I was on vacation.
        <br>
        <br>
        So here's what I've learnt:
    </p>

    <ul type="square">
        <li><strong>Numpy and Pandas:</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>So much easier to manage databases with pandas than with straight Python!</li>
            <li>That even though I still have MUCH to learn, I can functionally use numpy and pandas to do some neat things</li>
            <li>Googling seriously is your friend! So are ppl who write nice documentation and good stack overflow explanations</li>
            <li>I really do love this data analysis thing and can spend WAY more time on <a href="https://rebeccaebarnes.github.io/2018/04/24/real-data-analysis" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">projects</a> than is required</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Bootstrapping:</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Learning this was a truly 'mind blown' experience for me - while in some ways it is all about traditional statistics, but some much of "unlearn what you have learned" - in a good way</li>
            <li>The trend in statistics is to start showing how all my go-to statistical measures might not be as effective as we thought - <a href="https://lucklab.ucdavis.edu/blog/2018/4/19/why-i-lost-faith-in-p-values" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">p-values</a>, <a href="http://data.library.virginia.edu/is-r-squared-useless/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">r<sup>2</sup></a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.07588" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>null hypothesis testing!</strong></a> What are you all doing to me?! (I still need to write a post on all of this)</li>
            <li>How to estimate the <a href="https://rebeccaebarnes.github.io/2018/04/29/bootstrapping.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">parameters of a popluation</a>!! The fact that this previously unknown entity is just amazing to me</li>
            <li>How to <a href="https://rebeccaebarnes.github.io/2018/05/01/what-is-a-p-value.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">calculate a p-value</a> based on my hypotheses - important stuff here.</li>
            <li>I have once again become 'that student' - the person that has to know all the intricate details of why and pesters her instructors with questions pre-written down, waiting for them to be available!</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Mulitple linear regression:</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>The stats brain is alive and well!!</li>
            <li>The stats that I love relate to machine learning! I'm so looking forward to being able to get more into machine learning for modeling data</li>
            <li>How to use multiple regression and pandas to complete ANOVAs (I do like ANOVAs)</li>
            <li>That with the computational advances (and less focus on all of the technical math behind it), in the three months of Term 1 we are about half way through my 3rd year statistics course</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <li><strong>How to write READMEs:</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>The intimidating is now no longer so!</li>
            <li>I now need to go and write proper READMEs for all of my projects on GitHub</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Kaggle exists:</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>People who want to host datasets so that they can sit there for me to find and explore make me happy</li>
            <li>There is huge benefit in strong background knowledge before you start getting stuck into a dataset</li>
            <li>Data cleaning is REAL work! Hours spent just validating the structure of the data and making it usable</li>
            <li>I've started the very beginnings of my <a href="https://github.com/rebeccaebarnes/Homelessness" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">predicting changes in homelessness</a> project that I've wanted to do for a really long time</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Wasnt' accepted to the masters program:</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>This is sad but not the end of the line</li>
            <li>Currently sticking with the Udacity programs and seeing what I can make of that</li>
            <li>Will continue to review options as I go along</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>How to add videos in html:</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>The microsoft photo editing program has decided to allow you to make video editing changes</li>
            <li>Why, because it's fun :P See below!</li>
        </ul>
        </li>

        Definitely the more you learn, the more you realize what you don't know and there is to learn, but I'm having a lot of fun!
        So many places to explore, so many mountains to climb.
