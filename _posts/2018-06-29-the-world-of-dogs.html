        <strong>Dear fellow doggos and puppers,</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        It is I, Charlie the #numerophile (clearly distinguishable from other associations such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoxcjq-8xIDTYp3uz647V5A" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Numberphile</a> – no lawsuits, please!).
        And I have once again taken on the onerous task of deciphering the world of humans for you.
        In this article of <em>The World of Dogs</em> we have many tasty morsels for you.
        I have pawed through one of the sites that the humans seem to be obsessed with – <a href="https://twitter.com/dog_rates" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">WeRateDogs</a>, on Twitter.
    </p>
    <p>
        While their behaviour is once again questionable, and confusing – they think that they tweet on this site, but it looks nothing like tweeting, and certainly doesn’t sound anything like it, birds tweet, not humans, as evolved as they think they are, why do they want to be like birds, you know what birds are good for: chasing, that’s what, they humans ARE good for chasing, but they’re good for so many other things, like face liking, and snugs, and games of catch (remember, follow the ball with your eyes and not your heart…)
        But I see that I have digressed.
        What I actually wanted to say was that I’ve dug up some interesting facts for you, sniffed out the truth, and brought you some insights as good as a new bone to chew on.
        I have asked the tough questions:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Are the humans loving us less?</li>
        <li>What types of dogs do they <strong>really</strong> love?</li>
        <li>Do the humans agree what makes a good dog?</li>
        <li>How well can they actually tell us apart?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        As always my frens, I do this for you!
    </p>
    <p>
        Yours in puparedness,
    </p>

        As I have said many times, my frens, my job is to sniff around the tough questions.
        I’m sure, upon seeing this question, you can feel your shoulders drooping and your tail wagging a little less.
        But just like we need to meet a new dog from different angles, so it is with questions.
