    <p>
        It has been around 4.5 months since I started properly coding.
        Sometimes that kind of amazes me, so I wanted to take some time to reflect on some of the coding lessons I have learnt.
    </p>

    <ul type="square">
        <li><strong>My Number One Coding Strategy</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>I still feel like of all the elements of data analysis, the coding side is still my weakest</li>
            <li>My primary strategy for overcoming this is to realize that there are possibly millions of people who are better coders than I am, and these people like to help share solutions with others</li>
            <li>I've definitely said before that StackOverflow is a great resource, but honestly most of the time the reason I think I look like I know what I'm doing is because of all the great resources that others have made</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Four Steps to Newbie Debugging</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>I think especially as newbies there are common mistakes that we make in coding and a lot of them can be quickly identified with these three steps (apart from learning how to read the error messages). My guess is that 7-9/10, when I encounter an error, one of these three things has happened.</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Did you spell everything correctly? The amount of times that I have just copied down the variable or function name incorrectly is a source of so many errors - always a good place to start!</li>
            <li>Are the inputs you added what you think they are? Sometimes we add things into a function assuming we know what our input looks like, but sometimes we were wrong - are you certain you know what your inputs look like?</li>
            <li>Does the function operate the way that you think it does? I think that this is especially the case when function contain multiple methods, etc - do you know what each piece of the function does and is it behaving as you expectted?</li>
            <li>Edit: Added a fourth (borrowed from discussion with one of my friends) Did you try to interpret the error message? I go to the end of the function to read the message, and the start of the function to see the reference line and see what I can figure out.</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <li><strong>I learnt how to use R</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Learning R was a bit clunky at the start and I was definitely missing Python</li>
            <li>But I've become a huge fan of ggplot2 and the power it has - they layering concept really does make sense to me</li>
            <li>And it can make SUCH <a href="https://rebeccaebarnes.github.io/2018/06/11/making-predictions#5_multivariate_exploration" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pretty pictures</a></li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Accessing APIs and Scraping Webpages</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>This was something that I had heard people talk about, but had no idea how to do - I really felt like it lived within the land of "the coders' secrets"</li>
            <li>But now I've <a href="https://github.com/rebeccaebarnes/DAND-Project-7/blob/master/wrangle_act.ipynb" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">done it</a> and I already have plans for how to use it for some of the personal data analysis I do (I might show it to you sometime)</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <li><strong>My Brain Was Born for This</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>That's honestly how I feel these days, and I'm truly grateful for it - not everyone gets to find something like that in their life</li>
            <li>I continue to find that I have intuition about somethings that just 'make sense' to me - it's incredibly validating that things I've been doing on my own have value in my future pursuits</li>
            <li>I can happily do this for hours and find that more than taking energy from me, it regularly calms me down and gives it back - cool to think I might get paid to do it</li>
            <li>I've started the very beginnings of my predicting changes in homelessness</a> project that I've wanted to do for a really long time</li>
        </ul>
