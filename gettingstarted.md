## Getting Started

So how does one go about pursuing something of a change in trajectory to the world of data science? Well for me, the idea came about when [this](https://masterdatascience.science.ubc.ca/?utm_source=mds-landing-page&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=mds2018-shared&utm_content=Vancouver) popped up on my screen one day. To me, it sounded like everything I should be doing - a combination of coding and statistics that is all about helping people make real life decisions in the world. 

I research everything. 

  **So, first step:** look at the [entry requirements](https://masterdatascience.science.ubc.ca/admissions), hmm... 
      a. Undergrad course in statistics? Check
      b. Undergrad course in computer science? Nope, but I did that intro to python ages ago...
      c. Undergrad course in inferential statistics? Nope, but that's all that math I did in school, right?
      d. It does seem like they will accept real life alternatives, what are the options
  
  **Step two:** Evaluate other options!
      a. Review [suggested knowledge list](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/UBC-MDS/UBC-MDS.github.io/blob/master/selftest/mds_self_test.pdf): hmm, there's a lot of stuff on here I used to know that seems a bit greek right now
      b. Review list of [suggested 'brush up' courses](https://ubc-mds.github.io/resources_pages/prep_moocs/): Oh, MOOCS, I know those! And there's one from Udacity on the list...
      
  **Step three:** Check out what [Udacity is offering](https://www.udacity.com/courses/data-science)
      a. Review the free courses: ok, there's a bunch of stuff that seems promising, I wonder what I'd need to do to prove I've done this?
      b. Review the paid courses: interesting, but is it worth it?
      
  **Step four:** Check the submission date
      a. Applications not open yet? hmm, I have some time, I'll keep an eye on it
      
  **Step five:** Life takes over for a while
  
  **Step six:** (Sometime in January) Check on the application date again, ok, now it's up! March 23!
  
  **Step seven:** Re-ponder options with Udacity
      a. If I'm really gonna commit, the paid option is probably the best way to go
      b. Make an [application](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002), but courses don't start until February
      c. Start brushing up on [statistics](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-statistics--st101)
  
  *Step eight:** Start Data Analyst Nanodegree with Udacity!
