        As part of my ongoing project on homelessness, I'd like to tell you some stories...

        Sometimes that kind of amazes me, so I wanted to take some time to reflect on some of the coding lessons I have learnt...

        So, my blog kind of got overtaken by this very insistent doggo named Charlie.
