        This is what bootstrapping is like, yeah?
        In class we were told that the term comes from the idea of being stuck in quicksand and pulling yourself out by your own bootstraps...

        Third project for the DAND is done! We finally got into what I would call "real data analysis."
        I looked at the relationship between a country's economic strength and female participation in employment and education...

        Heading to the good ol' land of Oz in sunny Queensland for a few week's vacation (and a bit of Commonwealth Games).
        To me a good vacation consists of lying by a pool, or on the beach, doing not much, and reading...

        I think that the presentation of complex data can quickly end up causing the user to feel overwhelmed with the required interpretation.
        There is too much going on, and they can feel uncertain how to apply the information...
