                <p>So how does one go about pursuing something of a change in trajectory to the world of data science? Well for me, the idea came about when <a href = "https://masterdatascience.science.ubc.ca/?utm_source=mds-landing-page&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=mds2018-shared&utm_content=Vancouver">this</a>
                    popped up on my screen one day. To me, it sounded like everything I should be doing - a combination of coding and statistics that is all about helping people make real life decisions in the world.</p>
                <p>I research everything!</p>

                <h3>Step one: Can I do it?</h3>
                <ul type="square">
                    <li>Look at the <a href = "https://masterdatascience.science.ubc.ca/admissions">entry requirements</a>, hmm...
                    <li>Do I have....
                        <ul>
                            <li>An undergrad course in statistics? Check
                            <li>An undergrad course in computer science? Nope, there is that intro python class I took ages ago...
                            <li>An undergrad course in inferential statistics or linear algebra? Nope, but that's all that math I did in school, right?
                            <li>It does seem like they may accept real life alternatives, so what are my options?
                        </ul>
                </ul>

                <h3>Step two: Evaluate other options</h3>
                <ul type="square">
                    <li>Review the <a href = "http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/UBC-MDS/UBC-MDS.github.io/blob/master/selftest/mds_self_test.pdf">suggested knowledge list</a>. Hmm, there's a lot of stuff on here I used to know that seems a bit greek right now
                    <li>Review the list of <a href = "https://ubc-mds.github.io/resources_pages/prep_moocs/">suggested 'brush up' courses</a>. Oh, MOOCs, I know those! And there's one from Udacity on the list...
                </ul>

                <h3>Step three: Check out what Udacity is offering</h3>
                <ul type="square">
                    <li>Review the free courses. Ok, there's a bunch of stuff here that seems promising, I wonder what I'd need to do to prove I've done this?
                    <li>Review the paid courses. Hmm, this <a href = "https://www.udacity.com/courses/data-science">Data Analyst Nanodegree</a> looks interesting, but is the cost worth it? (Edit from the future: Yep, absolutely, totally recommend it!)
                </ul>

                <h3>Step four: Confirm application due date for UBC</h3>
                <ul type="square">
                    <li>Applications not open yet? Hmm, I have some time then, I'll keep an eye on it.
                </ul>

                <h3>Step five: Life takes over for a while</h3>
                <p>It happens...</p>

                <h3>Step six: (Sometime in January) Back to checking the application date</h3>
                <ul type="square">
                    <li>Ok, it's up! March 23!
                    <li>Time to get down to business!
                </ul>

                <h3>Step seven: Re-ponder options with Udacity</h3>
                <ul type="square">
                    <li>"If I'm really gonna commit, the paid option is probably the best way to go." (Edit from the future: It really is!)
                    <li>Make an application. Oh, the course doesn't start until February.
                    <li>Do some of the free courses in the mean time. Like brushing up on <a href = "https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-statistics--st101">statistics</a>.
                </ul>

                <h3>Step eight: Start Data Analyst Nanodegree!</h3>
                <ul type="square">
                    <li>Discover a world that I never really knew existed.
                    <li>Have the time of my life!
                </ul>
